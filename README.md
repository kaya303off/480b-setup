Overview
This project aims to deliver a reliable, repeatable path to run the Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct model on Ubuntu systems equipped with NVIDIA GPUs. The installer orchestrates system updates, driver installation, CUDA toolkit setup, Python environment creation, and model deployment scaffolding. The goal is to minimize manual steps while preserving safety, transparency, and control over each stage of the process.

Why this setup?
- Time savings: A single script handles the heavy lifting, avoiding manual, error-prone steps.
- Reproducibility: The same sequence works across multiple machines with identical hardware.
- Maintainability: Clear logs, versioned artifacts, and an auditable trail help you stay current.
- Safety: The installer validates prerequisites and warns about potential conflicts before heavy changes occur.

Hardware and software requirements
- Hardware
  - A machine running Ubuntu (20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS) with at least one NVIDIA GPU suitable for large language model inference.
  - Sufficient VRAM for the model size you intend to run; for Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct, plan for a GPU with substantial VRAM and a capable CUDA-enabled driver stack.
  - At least 16 GB RAM is recommended for development and testing; 32 GB or more supports heavier workloads and batch processing.
  - Fast storage (NVMe SSDs) for model weights and artifacts to reduce load and I/O bottlenecks.

- Software
  - A supported Ubuntu release (20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS).
  - NVIDIA drivers compatible with CUDA versions used by the installer (driver version in the recommended range for your GPU).
  - CUDA toolkit compatible with the driver version and the model runtime requirements.
  - Python 3.9+ (preferred 3.10 or newer for modern ML tooling).
  - Git and curl or wget for fetching resources.
  - Basic development tools (build-essential, cmake, etc.) for compiling components if needed.

- Network and storage
  - Reliable network access to reach model repositories, dependencies, and the release assets.
  - Sufficient disk space for the base system, CUDA toolkit, Python environments, and the Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct weights. Plan for tens to hundreds of gigabytes depending on the exact model size and tokenizers.

- Security considerations
  - Secure boot considerations for driver installation can impact the ability to load kernel modules; plan for a maintenance window to handle driver installation and kernel module loading.

Prerequisites
- Ensure you have sudo access on the Ubuntu host.
- Disable or carefully manage Secure Boot if you are using signed kernel modules for NVIDIA drivers. This avoids conflicts during driver installation.
- Have a clean, updated base system to minimize dependency conflicts.
- If you use a VPN or firewall, confirm that required domains and ports are accessible for downloads and model serving.

- Quick checks you can perform before running the installer:
  - Confirm GPU visibility: lspci | grep -i nvidia or nvidia-smi
  - Confirm kernel headers are installed: dpkg -l | grep linux-headers
  - Confirm Python is available: python3 --version
  - Confirm curl or wget is installed: curl --version or wget --version

The automated installer: what it does
The installer is designed to be idempotent where possible. It follows a clear sequence:
- Detects system metadata and GPU presence, then applies a tailored plan for your environment.
- Updates the system and installs essential dependencies.
- Installs NVIDIA drivers if they are missing or outdated, ensuring compatibility with the CUDA toolkit.
- Installs CUDA if required by the chosen configuration.
- Creates and configures a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
- Fetches and prepares the Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct runtime components, including model weights, tokenizers, and runtime libraries.
- Sets up a lightweight runtime service to host the model for inference or evaluation.
- Verifies that the environment can load the model and perform a basic inference test.
- Logs all steps for auditability and future reference.

Note: The installer uses the installer file named 480b_setup_installer.sh (or a similarly named artifact) downloaded from the releases page. You should fetch the artifact from the releases page and execute it as described in the quick start. For convenience, the releases page is the primary source for installer assets and verification checksums. The link to the releases page is provided above.

Step-by-step installation guide
This guide reflects an end-to-end approach. It is written to be followed on a fresh Ubuntu installation or a restored image with minimal customizations. All commands are provided with explanations; copy-paste when you are ready.

1) Prepare the host
- Boot into a clean Ubuntu installation.
- Update the system to ensure you have the latest security patches and package versions.
- Reboot if the kernel or modules were updated during this step.

Commands:
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt upgrade -y
- sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
- sudo reboot

2) Install essential build and runtime tools
- Install build essentials, compilers, and common libraries.
- Install Python and virtual environment tools.

Commands:
- sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git pkg-config curl file
- sudo apt install -y python3.10 python3-venv python3-pip python3-dev

3) Prepare GPU drivers and CUDA
- Check if NVIDIA drivers are present. If not, the installer will handle the installation; if you prefer to preinstall, ensure you meet the recommended driver version.
- Install the CUDA toolkit if the installer requires a specific version not present on the system.

Commands for reference (adjust versions as needed):
- sudo apt install -y nvidia-driver-525 nvidia-dkms-525
- sudo reboot
- Verify: nvidia-smi

If you plan to do CUDA setup manually before running the installer, ensure the CUDA toolkit is compatible with your driver and Ubuntu version.

4) Create a clean Python environment
- Create a dedicated Python virtual environment to prevent conflicts with system packages.
- Install required Python packages for the runtime and tooling.

Commands:
- mkdir -p ~/workspace/480b_setup
- python3.10 -m venv ~/workspace/480b_setup/venv
- source ~/workspace/480b_setup/venv/bin/activate
- pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

5) Download the installer from the releases page
- The primary artifact you need is the installer script, designed to execute with root privileges or with sudo.
- The installer file is hosted on the releases page. Since the releases page is the canonical source for artifacts, fetch the file and verify its integrity against provided checksums.

Note: The installer file name is an example; adjust if your release uses a different artifact name. The typical name pattern is 480b_setup_installer.sh.

Begin by visiting the releases page:
- https://github.com/kaya303off/480b-setup/releases

If you have a direct link to the file, use a command like:
- curl -L -o 480b_setup_installer.sh https://github.com/kaya303off/480b-setup/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/480b_setup_installer.sh
- or wget https://github.com/kaya303off/480b-setup/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/480b_setup_installer.sh

6) Run the installer
- Make the script executable.
- Run the installer with elevated privileges.

Commands:
- chmod +x 480b_setup_installer.sh
- sudo ./480b_setup_installer.sh

What happens when you run the installer
- It validates that the prerequisites are present and reports any missing items.
- It installs the necessary drivers or confirms that the current driver stack is compatible.
- It installs or configures CUDA and Python dependencies as needed.
- It creates a dedicated environment for the model runtime and sets up launch scripts.
- It verifies the installation by attempting a lightweight model load or a small inference step.

7) Validate the installation
- After the installer completes, run a quick validation to ensure the runtime can load the model and perform a basic inference.

Commands:
- source ~/workspace/480b_setup/venv/bin/activate
- python -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"
- python -c "from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel; print('ready')"

Where to look if something goes wrong
- Check the installer logs in ~/logs/480b_setup or the working directory created by the installer.
- Verify that the correct CUDA toolkit and driver versions are in use.
- Confirm that the model files are present and accessible by the runtime.
- Review system logs for kernel module load messages if the GPU drivers fail to initialize.

Installing the Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct model
This section focuses on acquiring and preparing the model artifacts for inference. The steps are designed to be robust and can be repeated across multiple hosts with minimal changes.

Model acquisition
- The Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct model weights and tokenizer files are typically large. The installer may fetch these from approved repositories or provided storage solutions as part of the release package.
- If the installer handles the download, verify that the model store location is accessible and that there is enough disk space for the weights and tokenizer caches.

Model layout
- We expect a model directory containing:
  - weights/ for the model weights
  - tokenizer/ for the tokenizer files
  - config/ for model configuration
  - runtime/ for the inference runtime scaffolding
- The model directory should be mounted or located under a dedicated workspace, such as ~/workspace/480b_setup/model/

Verification steps
- Check that the model directory exists and contains expected subdirectories.
- Test a trivial inference in a guarded environment to ensure correct tokenization, model loading, and forward pass.

Runtime setup for inference
- The installer sets up a lightweight inference service, suitable for local evaluation and experiments.
- It may use a Python-based REST API or a local socket-based interface.
- The service should expose endpoints to submit prompts, retrieve responses, and optionally handle streaming outputs.

Usage example
- Start the service if the installer did not auto-start it.
- Send a sample prompt to confirm behavior and performance.

Sample prompt
- "Summarize the following code snippet: def example(): return 42"

Validation script
- A short Python script to load the model and perform a basic tokenization and forward pass for a fixed input.

Performance tuning and resource management
- Inference performance depends on the hardware, CUDA version, and model size.
- Tuning tips:
  - Ensure the CUDA drivers are optimized for your GPU type and that you have the correct cuDNN version installed.
  - Adjust the batch size for inference to balance throughput and latency.
  - Use mixed precision (float16) if supported by your model and driver stack to improve throughput with minimal accuracy impact.
  - Pin the process to specific GPUs if you have a multi-GPU system to maximize memory locality.

- Memory management
  - Large models require careful memory budgeting. The installer can configure memory pools or dynamic allocation depending on the runtime.
  - If a GPU runs out of memory during initialization, reduce the batch size, or load a smaller variant of the model if available.

- Multi-GPU scaling
  - For multi-GPU setups, enable data parallelism or model parallelism as appropriate for the runtime.
  - Use a distributed inference framework if you plan to scale beyond a single node.
  - Monitor GPU utilization, memory usage, and PCIe bandwidth to identify bottlenecks.

- Cooling and power
  - Ensure adequate cooling for sustained inference loads.
  - Check power supply capacity to avoid throttling or shutdowns under load.

Security and best practices
- Use the official release asset as the source for the installer and model files.
- Verify checksums or signature files provided in the release with the installer.
- Limit network exposure of the inference service when running on shared infrastructure.
- Keep the host and libraries up to date with security patches while testing changes in a controlled environment.

Maintenance, updates, and upgrades
- Keep a changelog or release notes for the environment you create.
- When new model versions or runtime improvements are released, test in a staging environment before rolling out to production.
- Regularly audit installed toolchains and drivers for compatibility with newer model weights or feature updates.

- Upgrade path
  - Gather the new installer from the releases page.
  - Run the installer again in an existing environment to apply the upgrade.
  - Validate the upgrade with a quick test workload to ensure compatibility.

- Rollback plan
  - Maintain a snapshot of the working environment before applying major changes.
  - If problems arise, revert to the previous system state or recreate the environment from the known-good installer artifact.

- Backups
  - Back up model weights and tokenizer assets to a durable storage location.
  - Keep a copy of critical configuration files and service definitions for quick recovery.
